## Personal Intro

👋 Hi! I'm Javier. I'm passionate about web development and the challenge of building applications end to end. My background as a freelance Front-end UI developer gives me a strong foundation in UX/UI and in direct client collaboration. My ongoing learning roadmap focuses on deployment architecture and CI/CD, applied AI ecosystems, advanced interface design and UX with dynamic animations, and performance and Web Vitals.

I strive for continuous improvement to better serve teams, employers, and end users. I'm driven by teamwork, lifelong learning, autonomy with a problem-solving mindset, and attention to detail. I aim to grow as a Full Stack Developer in a team where I can learn from the best and add value from day one. If you think I’m a good fit for your project—or have suggestions for my growth—I’d love to connect!
